Basic PCAP IR Challenge

Triage Example
An analyst has escalated an issue to you, they believe that someone accessing the organization's website was attempting to exploit it, and the analyst believes the threat actor may have been successful and is escalating the alert to you. They have provided a PCAP of the traffic they observed. Please triage what has happened and write up an incident report, including any relevant MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.
